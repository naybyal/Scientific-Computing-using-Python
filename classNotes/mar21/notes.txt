    --  TURTLE GRAPHICS --  

Turtle Graphics toolkit provides a simple and enjoyable way to draw pictures in a window and gives you an
opportunity to run several methods with an object. 

Arrow head -> 
        initial position -> home  /_\ (x, y)  -> this arrow head is called turtle.

Turtle Attributes :
    -color  -> initially black; color can be changed to any of more than 16 million other colors.

    -width  -> thickness of the line drawn by the turtle, when it moves.
                initial width is 1px.

    -down   -> if the pen is down, we can draw the lines.
                This attribute which can either be true or false controls whether the turtle's pen is up or down.

                When true, the turtle draws a line when it moves.
                When false, the turtle can move w/out drawing a line.

    -heading->  direction that the turtle is facing. It initially points to the east.

                specified in degrees, the heading or direction increases in value as the turtle turns to the left
                or counter clockwise. Turtle intially faces the east or 0deg north-east 90deg



<import turtle> or <from turtle import *>

- TURTLE METHODS -

Turtle()
    -> creates a new turtle object and opens its window

    eg. t = Turtle()

home()
    -> moves turtle t to the center of the window and then points t to the east.

    eg. t.home()

up()
    -> raises turtle t's pen from the drawing surface.

    eg. t.up()

down()
    -> lowers turtle t's pen to the drawing surface.

    eg. t.down()

setheading(degrees)
    -> points turtle t in the indicated direction which is specified in degrees
            east    - 0deg
            north   - 90deg
            west    - 180deg
            south   - 270deg

    eg. t.setheading(90)

left(degrees)

    eg. t.left(90)

right(degrees)

    eg. t.right(90)

goto(x,y)
    -> 

forward(distance)
    -> moves turtle t to the specified distance in the current direction
    
position()
    -> return the current position of (x, y)

    eg.print(t.position())



OBJECT INSTANTIATION 

    the process of creating objects is called object instantiation  or simply instantiating an object.  

    eg. varName = ClassName(args)

    The Turtle class is defined in the turtle module. The following code then imports the Turtle class.

            from turtle import *    or      from turtle import Turtle

    the next code segement creates and returns a Turtle object and opens a drawing window.

            t = Turtle()
