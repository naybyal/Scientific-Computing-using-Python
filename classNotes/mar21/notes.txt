    --  TURTLE GRAPHICS --  

Turtle Graphics toolkit provides a simple and enjoyable way to draw pictures in a window and gives you an
opportunity to run several methods with an object. 

Arrow head -> 
        initial position -> home  /_\ (x, y)  -> this arrow head is called turtle.

Turtle Attributes :
    -color  -> initially black; color can be changed to any of more than 16 million other colors.

    -width  -> thickness of the line drawn by the turtle, when it moves.
                initial width is 1px.

    -down   -> if the pen is down, we can draw the lines.
                This attribute which can either be true or false controls whether the turtle's pen is up or down.

                When true, the turtle draws a line when it moves.
                When false, the turtle can move w/out drawing a line.

    -heading->  direction that the turtle is facing. It initially points to the east.

                specified in degrees, the heading or direction increases in value as the turtle turns to the left
                or counter clockwise. Turtle intially faces the east or 0deg north-east 90deg
