    IMAGE MANIPULATION OPERATIONS

            https://medium.com/@parasraorane/image-manipulation-in-python-without-external-libraries-8a7996b1155a

    //  import an image

        from image import Image

        image = Image("smokey.gif")
        image.draw()


i = Image(filename)
        loads and returns an image with the give file name 

i= Image(width, height)
        creates and returns a blank image with the given dimensions. The color of each pixel is white and the filename 
        is the empty string

i.getWidth()
        returns the width of i in pixels.

i.getHeight()
        returns the height of i in pixels.

i.getPixel(x, y)
        returns a tuple of integers representing the RGB values of the pixel at the position (x, y)

i.setPixel(x,y, (r,g,b))
        replaces the RGB values at the position (x,y) with the RGB value given by the tuple (r,g,b)

i.draw()
        display i in a window

        the user must close the window to return control to the methods caller

i.clone()
        returns a copy of i

i.save()
        saves i under its current filename

i.save(filename)
        saves i under filename and automatically adds a '.gif' extension if the filename doesn't contain it.






//      using Pillow

Sure, here are the corresponding notes for image manipulation operations using the Pillow (PIL) library in Python:

```python
from PIL import Image
```

- **Import an image**:
  ```python
  image = Image.open("smokey.gif")
  image.show()
  ```

- **Create an image**:
  ```python
  image = Image.new('RGB', (width, height), 'white')
  ```

- **Get image dimensions**:
  ```python
  width, height = image.size
  ```

- **Get pixel RGB values**:
  ```python
  pixel_value = image.getpixel((x, y))
  ```

- **Set pixel RGB values**:
  ```python
  image.putpixel((x, y), (r, g, b))
  ```

- **Display image**:
  ```python
  image.show()
  ```

- **Clone an image**:
  ```python
  cloned_image = image.copy()
  ```

- **Save image**:
  ```python
  image.save("output_image.jpg")
  ```

Now, let's compare these methods with the ones from your medium link:

| Image Manipulation Operation | Pillow (PIL) | Without External Libraries |
|------------------------------|--------------|---------------------------|
| Import an image              | `Image.open("filename")` | `Image("filename")` |
| Create an image              | `Image.new('mode', (width, height), 'color')` | `Image(width, height)` |
| Get image dimensions         | `image.size` | Not mentioned |
| Get pixel RGB values         | `image.getpixel((x, y))` | Not mentioned |
| Set pixel RGB values         | `image.putpixel((x, y), (r, g, b))` | Not mentioned |
| Display image                | `image.show()` | `image.draw()` |
| Clone an image               | `image.copy()` | Not mentioned |
| Save image                   | `image.save("filename")` | `image.save(filename)` |

It's important to note that Pillow (PIL) is a powerful library that provides a wide range of image manipulation capabilities, including support for various image formats, resizing, cropping, filtering, and more.
