    IMAGE MANIPULATION OPERATIONS

            https://medium.com/@parasraorane/image-manipulation-in-python-without-external-libraries-8a7996b1155a

    //  import an image

        from image import Image

        image = Image("smokey.gif")
        image.draw()


i = Image(filename)
        loads and returns an image with the give file name 

i= Image(width, height)
        creates and returns a blank image with the given dimensions. The color of each pixel is white and the filename 
        is the empty string

i.getWidth()
        returns the width of i in pixels.

i.getHeight()
        returns the height of i in pixels.

i.getPixel(x, y)
        returns a tuple of integers representing the RGB values of the pixel at the position (x, y)

i.setPixel(x,y, (r,g,b))
        replaces the RGB values at the position (x,y) with the RGB value given by the tuple (r,g,b)

i.draw()
        display i in a window

        the user must close the window to return control to the methods caller

i.clone()
        returns a copy of i

i.save()
        saves i under its current filename

i.save(filename)
        saves i under filename and automatically adds a '.gif' extension if the filename doesn't contain it.
